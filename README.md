You may also open a project folder by path

```

## TODO

- [ ] Add other jetbrains IDEs (currently only IntelliJ, WebStorm, and PHPStorm are supported)
- [ ] Cross platform support (currently only OSX is supported)
- [ ] Allow alternate install locations
- [ ] Allow application to be passed as an option
